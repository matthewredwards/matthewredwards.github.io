								<h1>About Us</h1>
								<p>At Rocket City Rubs, we believe fire and smoke do more than cook food—they bring people together. The best meals aren't just about great flavor; they're about conversation, connection, and making memories around the grill.</p>
								<p>What started as a backyard experiment quickly became a family passion. Batch after batch, we chased balance, depth, and that "one more bite" feeling. Before long, friends and neighbors were asking for our blends—and a local tradition was ready to launch.</p>
								<p>Today, Rocket City Rubs is proud to craft small batch BBQ rubs and spice blends right here in Huntsville, Alabama. Every blend is carefully developed, tested, and packed to deliver bold flavor without shortcuts. We honor both the science and the soul of great barbecue.</p>
								<p>Our mission is simple:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Quality:</strong> Locally crafted, small batch rubs made with purpose</li>
									<li><strong>Community:</strong> Celebrating great food shared with friends and family</li>
									<li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Bold, thoughtfully layered flavors that push BBQ forward</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Whether you're firing up the backyard grill or feeding a crowd, Rocket City Rubs is here to help you cook with confidence—and bring people together, one great meal at a time.</p>
